# HackerRank Coding Challenges
This repository contains a collection of basic and moderately complex coding challenges that I have completed in my spare time.

Hackerrank (https://www.hackerrank.com) is a website which presents a number of programming problems which vary in complexity. The goal is to provide the best solution to the problem presented as well as passing all of the Test Cases provided.

## Repository Description
Each folder in this repository contains a different coding challenge solution.

I have included a link to the hackerrank problem that the code solves at the top of the Program.cs file's within each folder.

You can run the code within Visual studio using the sample input provided in the hackerrank link or you can copy and paste the code into the hackerrank coding window below the problem description and run it.

### Note
I will periodically add more coding solutions to this repository overtime adding multiple coding challenge solutions at a time.
